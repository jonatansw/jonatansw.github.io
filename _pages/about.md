I am a postdoctoral research associate at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/) where I am working for [ORCA-HUB](https://orcahub.org/). My current work focuses on autonomous behaviours related to feasible path-planning for start-to-goal queries and autonomous exploration and inspection. 
I did my PhD at said university which I finished at the beginning of 2020. The thesis was about cooperative navigation for autonomous marine robots. The thesis can be downloaded here [Cooperative Navigation Between Surface and Sub-surface Vehicles](http://jonatansw.github.io/files/papers/thesis.pdf).

I am originally from an island in the middle of the Baltic sea, [Gotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotland), which is a part of Sweden. I moved to Västerås, in Sweden (not the same as Game of Thrones!) to study a Master of Science in Engineering in Robotics at MDH, [Mälardalens University](https://www.mdh.se/en/malardalen-university?), a 5 year combined BSc and MSc degree. During the last year, I was part of a group building an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, [Naiad](https://www.facebook.com/NaiadAUV/), which can be seen below. We went to compete in [RoboSub](https://robosub.org/) with Naiad in San Diego, CA, US in 2015. This sparked my passion for underwater robotics.

After my finishing my degree MDH, I moved to Linköping to work at [SAAB Dynamics](https://www.saab.com/)'s computer vision department, where I was working on a SLAM project which later was released as a spin-off company, [CIND](https://www.cind.se/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAhP2BBhDdARIsAJEzXlGaOZnf1TDB4RNZAv9p5J61QQBDPD-D-OWsllraF62tAAhvWv8pFgEaAk5TEALw_wcB). After a year at SAAB I moved to Edinburgh to continue in the field I am most passionate about, marine robotics. My doctoral studies was a joint collaboration between Heriot-Watt University and [Seebyte](https://www.seebyte.com/). During the studies, I also had the opportunity to spend 6 months as a visiting researcher at [Australian Centre for Field Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html).
